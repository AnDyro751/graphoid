# Graphoid
This gem is used to generate a full GraphQL API using introspection of Mongoid or ActiveRecord models.
After installing it, you will have create, update, delete, and query actions on any rails models you want.

## Dependency
This gem depends on the graphql gem for rails https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby
So please install that gem first before continuing

## Installation
Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphoid'
```

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Configuration
Create the file `config/initializers/graphoid.rb`
And configure the database you want to use in it.

```ruby
Graphoid.configure do |config|
  config.driver = :mongoid
  # or
  config.driver = :active_record
end
```

## Usage
You can determine which models will be visible in the API by including the Graphoid Queries and Mutations

```ruby
class Person
  include Graphoid::Queries
  include Graphoid::Mutations
end
```

You can also include a special concern that will let you create virtual fields and forbid access to existing fields
```ruby
class Person
  include Graphoid::Graphield

  graphield :full_name, String # virtual fields need to resolve as a method
  graphorbid :balance # attribute balance will not be exposed in the API

  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end
```
