[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxiperezc/graphoid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxiperezc/graphoid)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/graphoid.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/graphoid)

Generates a full GraphQL API using introspection of Mongoid or ActiveRecord models.

## Dependency
This gem depends on [the GraphQL gem](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby).

Please install that gem first before continuing

## Installation
Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphoid'
```

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Configuration
Create the file `config/initializers/graphoid.rb`
And configure the database you want to use in it.

```ruby
Graphoid.configure do |config|
  config.driver = :mongoid
  # or
  config.driver = :active_record
end
```

## Usage
You can determine which models will be visible in the API by including the Graphoid Queries and Mutations

```ruby
class Person
  include Graphoid::Queries
  include Graphoid::Mutations
end
```

You can also include a special concern that will let you create virtual fields and forbid access to existing fields
```ruby
class Person
  include Graphoid::Graphield

  graphield :full_name, String # virtual fields need to resolve as a method
  graphorbid :balance # attribute balance will not be exposed in the API

  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end
```

## Examples
You can find an example that uses ActiveRecord in the [Tester AR folder](https://github.com/maxiperezc/graphoid/tree/master/spec/tester_ar) and an example with Mongoid in the [Tester Mongo folder](https://github.com/maxiperezc/graphoid/tree/master/spec/tester_mongo) of this same repository.
